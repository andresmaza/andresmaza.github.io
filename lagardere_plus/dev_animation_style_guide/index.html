		<div>Case Study Thumbnail (on Work Landing)
</div>
		<div>Slideshow Animation and Interactions
</div>
		<div>Please do not replicate any glitchy/buggy animation. All animations should be smooth.
</div>
		<div>Loading Animations

		<div>Contact Us Toggle Between Map and Image
</div>
		<div>The example below shows ideally how content would load onto the page.
In addition, we would like for content to animate as it comes into
view. Meaning that text, images and color blocks would animate in as users
scroll down the page.

Images and text simply fade in (unless noted otherwise). Any color block element
(excluding buttons) would follow the animation direction referenced below.

At any point refresh the page to see animation again.
</div>
		<div>Thumbnail image moves 20px top and 10px right. Color block moves 10px left.
</div>
		<div>Secondary Button
</div>
		<div></div>
		<div>Standard Button
</div>
		<div>All buttons should follow the Standard Button hover interaction.
</div>
		<div>Team Member Thumbnail
</div>
		<div>Follows the same hover animation as the work
landing thumbnail but uses two images. One would
be uploaded as B&W and one in color.

Also note that there shouldn’t be any hover animation on a
team member that has no team bio available.
